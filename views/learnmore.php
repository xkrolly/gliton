		-CTT stands for Category-Topic-Title.
		</div>
		<div style='font-size:14px; padding:10px;'>
		-An accurate CTT is vital for every problem you are solving. Picking the right CTT will grant you high chances of getting approval without delay. If you are having trouble forming the right CTT, kindly watch this <a href='#'>short tutorial on our youtube channel</a>.
		</div>
		<div style='font-size:14px; padding:10px;'>
		-If none of the categories or topics listed matches the solution you want to create, kindly pick the option 'Others' and a space is provided to write out what you feel is the best for the category. This will be reviewed and approved as appropriate.
		</div>
		<div style='font-size:14px; padding:10px;'>
		-Picking a succinctly descriptive title is very important and to arrive at this, the following guidelines should be followed:


			<div style='padding:10px; font-size:12px; font-style:italic;'>
				<p style='margin-bottom:5px;'>
				Title should reflect the uniqueness of your solution approach by quantifying all or either of the following parameters in figures:</p>
				<p style='margin-bottom:5px;'>
		          1) Material input or output E.g. How to cultivate and harvest 50tons of cassava on 1acre of land</p>
				<p style='margin-bottom:5px;'>
		              2) % efficiency E.g. How to raise broilers to market weight in just 4weeks with 50% of feed requirement
		        </p>
				<p style='margin-bottom:5px;'>
					  3) Duration E.g. How to cultivate and harvest cassava in just 2 months</p>

		<div style='font-size:14px; padding:10px;'>
		-It represents the captured image or video detail of the problem you want to solve OR the end-result of the problem you are solving after the solution approach has been applied. This end-result is then captured in video or snapped as image for posting and eventual publication along with the captured detail of the entire solution application steps.</div>
		
		<div style='font-size:14px; padding:10px;'>
		-When capturing CVE, ensure that all the indicative pointers that the problem exist(Problem CVE) or that the solution has been achieved(solution CVE) are captured and explained in detailed in the video. 
		</div>
		<div style='font-size:14px; padding:10px;'>
		-When capturing CVE, ensure that it is done in a well illuminated environment for clarity to avoid shades and unclear CVE as unclear CVE may not scape through approval stage.
